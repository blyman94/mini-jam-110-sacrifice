  Name: Dad's Chess Set
  Description: "An old chessboard my dad gave me in high school. I loved playing
    but fell out of practice over time. Chess was the one game I could get Charlotte
    to play regularly. She wasn\u2019t great at it, but she thought it was more dignified
    than the board games I brought home from time to time. I remember her winning
    with ease one night. She had this look in her eyes when she looked down at all
    the pieces she took from me.\r\n\nI think that it would look nice in the new
    apartment. And I would like to have a reminder of dad back in the house. But
    I don\u2019t think I want the white pieces. Those are Charlotte\u2019s. I can
    find replacements to make something that\u2019s really my own.\r\n"
