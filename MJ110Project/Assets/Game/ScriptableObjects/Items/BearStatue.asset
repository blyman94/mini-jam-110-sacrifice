  Name: Northbridge Music Festival Award
  Description: "An award Charlotte won after a performance in her hometown. It was
    the first time I got to see her play professionally. That night was really special
    for both of us in hindsight. I met her parents, she proved her skills, and everyone
    had a blast.\n\nI don\u2019t get why she left this one behind out of all the
    awards. I guess I could take it as a reminder of that night. After that it felt
    like our relationship was more serious, more adult. If I could, I would go back
    to that time.\r"
