  Description: "A globe that Charlotte brought with her when we first moved in together.
    I never understood why she kept it on her nightstand. I guess I chalked it up
    to the fact that she didn\u2019t have a home office to keep it in. But now? Now
    it makes sense. She wasn\u2019t exaggerating when she talked about traveling
    the world and seeing the seven continents.\r\n\nThis might make a nice piece
    to bring home. It would help me keep Charlotte in mind and remind me to think
    bigger, to have a little ambition like she wanted me to. Maybe I could finally
    be what she needs.\r\n"
