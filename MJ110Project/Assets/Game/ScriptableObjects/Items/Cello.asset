  Description: "I can\u2019t believe Charlotte actually left this behind. I guess
    she wasn\u2019t kidding when she said she wanted to \u201Cmove on completely.\u201D
    When we were apartment hunting together for the first time she would make sure
    each place had enough room for this behemoth. She really has grown past the girl
    I once knew.\r\n\nI might not know how to play it, but I could learn. And it
    would be a nice reminder of what once was. Someone has to remember our love,
    right? Especially if she won\u2019t.\r\n"
