  Description: "A water gun I bought for the 4th of July one year. Charlotte\u2019s
    nieces and nephews had a blast when I busted this bad boy out and joined their
    game. She thought it was ridiculous that I wanted to own one, even if it was
    just for playing with her brother\u2019s kids.\r\n\nMaybe this has a home in
    my new life, a life where fun doesn\u2019t have to be so serious all the time.\r\n"
