  Description: "A rubber duck from my childhood. It\u2019s gone with me to every
    place I\u2019ve ever called home. When I first told Charlotte that she laughed
    at me and asked if I was joking. She warmed up to the idea eventually but she
    definitely thought of it as a childish tradition.\r\n\nI\u2019m not sure why
    I didn\u2019t take it with me when I first moved out. I guess I was hoping it
    wouldn\u2019t be permanent, that I wouldn\u2019t have to call that rundown one-room
    in a basement home. Maybe it\u2019s time to face the facts.\r\n"
