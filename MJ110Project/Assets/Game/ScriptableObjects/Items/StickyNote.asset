  Name: Sticky Note From Charlotte
  Description: "A note Charlotte left for me. It reads:\r\n\r\nHey Ash, just wanted
    to let you know that I\u2019m leaving this place for good. Anything still here
    is up for grabs. It\u2019s either yours or stuff I couldn\u2019t bring with me.
    No matter who it used to belong to, feel free to take it. My sister will be coming
    by at the end of the month to take whatever you don\u2019t. Good luck and goodbye.\r\nCharlotte
    \r\n\r\nHuh. No \u201CI love you\u201D at the end of it. I guess it really is
    over.\r\n"
