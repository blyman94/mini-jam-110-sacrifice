  Description: "Charlotte\u2019s old record player. Before we moved in together I
    had never owned one, I just used CDs or streaming services. But she was a real
    vinyl purist. She bought new records regularly and would try and get me to understand
    the appeal. I humored her but never really picked up on what made it special.
    \r\n\nI could try and learn to appreciate it now. Charlotte always said I had
    a \u201Climited musical perspective.\u201D I could branch out and prove her wrong.
    Hell, maybe it would prove I\u2019m more mature than she thinks.\r\n"
