  Description: "An old mask I picked up at a renaissance fair during college. That
    was back before I met Charlotte. After we started dating I tried taking her to
    one, but she was miserable. I haven\u2019t been since. \n\nI really miss those
    days, when I could indulge my hobbies and interests without feeling guilty. Maybe
    I should call up Keith and see if he still goes. I have a lot more time on my
    hands now.\r"
