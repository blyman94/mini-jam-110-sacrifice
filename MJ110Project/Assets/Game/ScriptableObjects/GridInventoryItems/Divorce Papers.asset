  Name: Divorce Papers
  Description: "Looks like she left some of the paper work behind. Legal documents,
    bills from her lawyer, even the Certificate of Service. There\u2019s also a copy
    of the divorce record. I guess she took the originals with her. The Certificate
    of Service reads:\r\n\r\n<i>I hereby certify that I have served a copy of this
    motion upon: Ash O\u2019Connell, 2101 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts,
    02116 by \u2013 delivery in hand on 1/17/2022 \u2013 mailing postage paid on
    1/16/2022. \r\nFranklin Reid\r</i>\n\r\nAt least he was polite when he served
    me the papers in-person.\r\n"
