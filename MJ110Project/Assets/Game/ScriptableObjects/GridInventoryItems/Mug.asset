  Description: "This one was always Charlotte\u2019s favorite mug. She would always
    say something about how it wasn\u2019t the prettiest but it was the most comfortable.
    It\u2019s a shame she couldn\u2019t take it with her, I know she wanted to.\r\n\nMaybe
    I could take it instead and hold on to it. I could run into her one day and say,
    \u201CRemember that mug? I still have it, if you want it back.\u201D It might
    be wishful thinking, but at least it would remind us of the good times.\r\n"
